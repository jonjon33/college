Lab #7 Design and Programming Log

Design:
This program provides descriptive statistics for a set of data. Data is
provided through a file stream, and output is written to another file.

Since it is required that no C++ be used, the file stream and standard
I/O are written in C stdio functions. Function parameters are passed by
pointer so that all true values remain in the main program.

Required fuctions are:
 - ShowHeader()   -   Prints output to outfile
 - ReadColumn()   -   Inputs data from file
 - UpdateDescriptiveStats   -   Finds min, max, avg
 - CalcStdDev()   -   Finds stdDev

Log:
-Issue: Reading an extra item from file
    - By having the fscanf in ReadColumn() execute in the while logic, the
      problem of reading an extra value after the last value but before 
      the EOF was fixed.
-Issue: Passing arguments by pointer
    - Different data types functioned differently when passed by pointer to
      a function. Files and arrays did not require astrisks when accessed
      in a function, and ints and double had to be passed in main with 
      ampersands. Learning the different syntactical oddities remedied this.
-Issue: How to square root
    - Square root is available through the C math libraries. sqrt takes a
      double and returns the square root.
-Issue: Only recieving 0. for standard deviation
    - Using itemCount in the calculation of stdDev was a problem because
      itemCount is an int. The resulting trucation was fixed by assigning
      itemCount to a double.
