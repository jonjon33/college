- Issue: Only first character of any given argument was returned

This problem was a result of using the following line:
		*cPtr = argv;
This gave cPtr the value of the first char of the string of a given
element of argv[] (argv[0] above), which proved quite confusing.
By adjusting to 
		cPtr = argv[i];
I was able to access the entire argument.


- Issue: Input error checking required

It was quite a struggle to figure out how to make sure the program 
recognized silly input like "12three4".  It turned out that cPtr
could be set equal to a cell of the array argv[] (which was a string)
and then the string could be traversed by using the index i and
the array cPtr[i].


- Issue: * is a special key

Creating the calculator went smoothly except for the 
multiplication operator.  The character '*' has a special
function that causes it to be unusable in its simple form.
This is discussed more in answer to question d).


a) What is the first argument?
	The first argument is always the file name and location.
For this it was "./part1".

b) What is the last argument?
The last argument is the last one I passed, which varies from execution
to execution.

c) What happens when the argument to one or both of these is of
the wrong type, e.g., two instead of 2?
	While code with weaker error handling would not be able
to properly execute the conversion if provided an awkward argument
such as "two", this Part 3 program knows not to accept anthing other
than numeric characters for an int and nothing other that numeric 
characters and a decimal point for a float.

D) Does your program work for all the standard mathematical oper-
ators?
	The Part 4 program does not work for all the standard mathematical
operators.  The opertator for multiplication (the '*' character) has a
special purpose for arguments.  It indicates that all of something be
included.  In the case of ./part4 12 * 10, all the other files at the location
./ are passed as arguments, which produces an error.
