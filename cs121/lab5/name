Lab #5 Programming Log

Objective:
Gain an introductory understanding of the construction and
implementation of Makefiles.

Questions:
Invoke make testStack:
 a. What files are compiled?
     stack.cpp, list.cpp, and testStack.cpp

 b. What is the last argument?
     The last argument on the last line of the makefileâ€™s output is the
     link.o file.  This object file was created earlier in the make
     process and is used here to compile the testStack executable file.

Invoke make clean:
 a. What happened?
     The executable file and object files were removed.

Log:
This lab did not require difficult design considerations.  Code was
aquired from Bolden's site for the make file and the target files
without any problems.  The two parts of the lab (making the stack
and making the queue) were kept in separate directories for
simplicity.

Changing from compiling testStack to compiling testQueue only
required changing references to file names in the makefile.  The
structure and details are left exactly the same.

-Issue: Errors compiling the Queue code from Bolden's website
  - using namespace std required for each file
  - #include<bool> is not a valid include
  - Filenames must be consistantly capitalized across usage
