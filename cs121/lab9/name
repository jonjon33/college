Lab #9 Programming Log

Programming Log:
This lab allowed for a more in depth attempt at the problems posed in the 
previous data structures exam.  It comprised several disjoint problems with
their own challenges.  It took a full two hours of effort to put together the
program covering all the problems.  Challenges and solutions for each part
are discussed below.

Part 1
This didn't pose any serious individual challenges. My goal was to implement
the stack without referring to any of my previous code, and I was mostly
successful though there were a few syntax errors (forgetting the semicolon after
the end curly brace or forgetting a "Stack::").  I ended up going back to add a
IsEmpty() function, as it can be extremely beneficial for traversal outside of
the methods.

Part 2
This proved simple enough.  The one major hang up I had was I could not figure
out how to get the resulting list in the function back to the main function. I
settled with including another list passed by reference to be the result list.
Otherwise it just required clever Popping, Pushing, Adding, and Removing.

Part 3
Similarly simple, once the list object was properly in place.  Store the
positive values in a temporary list, then write that list to the old list
(which was passed by reference).  This part didn't work immediately, but it was
due to a simple mistake in the comparison in the if statement.
