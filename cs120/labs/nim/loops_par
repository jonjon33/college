The do-while and the while are extremely similar loops.  The do-while will
check the expression after executing the statements, and the while will
check the expression and then execute the statements.  There is only one
difference in the way these function in my code.  The do-while needs an
if statement that runs the code if num_objects != 1.  Otherwise, even if
there are zero objects, the do-while will execute once and then check
num_objects, printing an unnecessary object.  In this project, it saves a
few lines of code to use the while loop, but both loops have their place
in C code.
