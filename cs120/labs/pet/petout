Write 6-8 weaknesses or improvements for the pet program in the textbook.
  - ‚ÄúInvalid choice‚Äù should be stated for improper input in the main menu
  - When an invalid choice is entered in the play menu, user should be returned to the play menu not the main menu
  - There should be an option in the play menu to return to the main menu without playing (not just the default option, but an actual menu option)
  - The pet‚Äôs hunger shouldn‚Äôt go below 0.  It should refuse food or die from over eating when its hunger is negative.
  - There should be more options for feeding the pet
  - The pet should communicate with the user, asking to play or to eat or simply stating that it is happy or full
  - Perhaps eventually the program could have different types of pets that prefer different types of food or play

Write the changes you made to the program.
I made all the assigned changes.
  - I fixed all the menus to recognize invalid choices and made it easy to navigate between menus
  - I added an option for feeding the pet
  - I added an option for playing with the pet
  - I gave the pet a response for each option in the feed menu
  - I gave the pet a response for each option in the play menu
