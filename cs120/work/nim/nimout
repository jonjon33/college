Welcome to NIM.
I am your computer opponent, and likely your intellectual superior.
You and I will take turns taking objects from a pile.
Whoever takes the last object loses.
Good luck, you'll need it.

Since I'm feeling generous, you may select the number of objects in the pile. (input a postive integer): 27
Additionally, you may select the largest quantity of objects you or I can take in a turn. (input a postive integer): 4

Those will do nicely.

Up to 4 objects can be taken in a turn.
27 objects remaining

I have randomly decided that I will go first.

I remove 1
26 objects remaining. 

Enter your move (1-4): 4
22 objects remaining.

1 objects remaining. 

Enter your move (1-4): 1

I am not surprised that your feeble mind was unable to defeat me.

You have won 0 games and I have won 1 games.

Would you like to play again? Yes


How many objects would you like in the pile this time? 33
What is the largest quantity of objects a player may take this time? 9

This will make for an interesting game.
